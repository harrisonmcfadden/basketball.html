  <h1>How Controllers Work</h1>

  <p>Controllers help you control the player in a game.</p>

  <p>When you press a button:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The game sees it</li>
    <li>The player moves or jumps</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>Press A -> Player Passes or switch players </p>
  <p>Press B -> Player sets screen</p>
  <p>Press Y -> Player Jumps</p>
  <p>Press X -> Player Shoot/ Steal </p>
  <p>How does this work?</p>
  <p>A game controller sends signals to the game system when you press buttons or move sticks.
These signals tell the system what you want the game to do like jump, move, or shoot.</p>
