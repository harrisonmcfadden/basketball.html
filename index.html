  <h1>How Controllers Work</h1>

  <p>Controllers help you control the player in a game.</p>

  <p>When you press a button:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The game sees the signal</li>
    <li>The player moves or jumps</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For Example:</p>
  <p>Press A -> Player Passes or switch players </p>
  <p>Press B -> Player sets screen</p>
  <p>Press Y -> Player Jumps</p>
  <p>Press X -> Player Shoot/ Steal </p>
  <p>How does this work?</p>
  <p>A game controller sends signals to the game system when you press buttons or move sticks.
These signals tell the system what you want the game to do, like jump, move, or shoot.</p>
