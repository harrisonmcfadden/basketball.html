  <h1>How Controllers Work using 2k </h1>

  <p>A controller with sensors is like a magic remote that can feel how you move it. When you tilt or shake it, 
    tiny parts inside notices the movement and tell the game. The game then changes whatâ€™s happening on screen 
    based on how you move the controller.</p>

  <p>When you press a button:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The game sees the signal</li>
    <li>The player moves or jumps</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For Example:</p>
  <p>Press A -> Player Passes or switch players </p>
  <p>Press B -> Player sets screen</p>
  <p>Press Y -> Player Jumps</p>
  <p>Press X -> Player Shoot/ Steal </p>
  <p>How does this work?</p>
  <p>A game controller sends signals to the game system when you press buttons or move sticks.
These signals tell the system what you want the game to do, like jump, move, or shoot.</p>
